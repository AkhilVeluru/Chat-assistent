# Chat-assistant

From the learning of a course named "GPT-4 Foundations: Building AI-Powered Apps," by Denys Linkov, I built a tiny digital assistant.

Project overview:

ü§ñ Chatbot Building with Voiceflow: I created a full-scale chatbot using prompt chaining, powered by GPT-3.5 Turbo, on the Voiceflow platform. I trained it to handle classification prompts, follow-up prompts, and question-answering prompts.

üåê Web Integration: Published my chatbot into a local website copy of the Big Star Collectibles website, transforming it into an interactive platform.
